LSRSauditFormHandler
====================

A set of Google App Scripts to manage a set of Google Forms.

Educause (educause.edu) has established the LSRS (Learning Space Rating System) initiative to rate learning spaces such as classrooms and labs on their effectiveness towards active learning.  The classroom technology department at Southern Polytechnic State University began incorporating the LSRS initiative, using the provided resources to design a set of Google Forms and Sheets.

The LSRSauditFormHandler is a set of app script (a cloud-based scripting language based on Javascript) to manage and improve the interactions between the Google Form and the Sheet.
